# Collabofy

The Music Collaboration App is a web-based platform designed to help musicians, producers, and audio engineers collaborate remotely. Unlike existing platforms like SoundCloud, which focus on sharing finished music, our solution enables real-time collaboration during the creative process.

With features like file sharing, version control, timestamped feedback, and real-time messaging, this app will provide an interactive and efficient way for artists to work together, regardless of their location.
